* Researchers often use spreadsheets to detail complex information about laboratory experiments.
* Yet researchers are burdened by inefficient use of spreadsheets.
* LiteLIMS reenvisions spreadsheets alongside relational databases to advance capturing complex information.
* As indicated in results figure A, researchers may access four Sheets to create a catalog of items (shown in brown), identify physical material (shown in blue), plan processes (shown in bright green), and detail executed processes (shown in dark green).
*  As indicated in results figure B, researchers may use a fifth Sheet to define reporting workflows, which are sequences of processes.
* As indicated in results figure C, reporting workflows guide researchers through sequences of activities from top to bottom within the Sheet. 
* From left to right within the Sheet, the columns guide researchers through reporting an individual activity. Thus, one row is a description of one activity.
* LiteLIMS reenvisions spreadsheets to efficiently capture complex information and facilitate the long-term value of research output.
